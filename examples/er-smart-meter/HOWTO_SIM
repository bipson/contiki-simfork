- adjust payload size in er-smart-meter.c (currently up to 128B)
- issue: make TARGET=cooja sim_1hop_1req.csc > /dev/null & (use respective topology -> *.csc file)
- issue: make connect-router-cooja (repeat from here when reloading simulation in cooja)
- in cooja: limit simulation speed to 100% (yes, there is a little bit of clock skew)
- in cooja: start simulation (if more than 2 servers directly connected to border router, right click on border router node (node 1) and "push button" to rebuild RPL DAG some time after simulation has started)
- issue: sh request_loopX.sh <timeout> (replace 'X' with 1/2/4, number of requests sent out -> use same number as used for Xreq in the topology, <timeout> is number of seconds for the script to output ERROR if request not finished until then)
- wait for script output, it will ping the nodes and start the requests only if they are all reachable (rebuild RPL DAG if necessary) 
- script output shows ERROR for all requests that did not work, OK if requests ok
- script will repeat requests 10 times.


http requests can be simulated the same way by using the respective files in ../rest-example

Known Issues:
- Clock skew should be measured to know uncertainty of results
- Hopefully the used clients reliably answer ERROR on error
- Rebuilding the DAG might be necessary for a few consecutive times. On the other hand, the border router sometimes just needs a little see to find all nodes. Script will retry until all nodes reached.
- Depending on the host of the VM, it might be necessary to restart VirtualBox completely (at least under linux sometimes the modul runs amok and causes strange clock behavior)
